Mission for testing dynamic mustering and convoying for Sea Train project

To Run:

$ ./launch.sh --amt=4 10      (4 vehicles, timewarp 10)

(a) After launching, hit the DEPLOY button. This will start the vehicles
moving toward their muster region

(b) After all the vehicles have arrived in the muster region and are stationary,
click the CONVOY button to begin the vehicles on a convoy pattern to the
destination.

(c) After the lead vehicle reaches the destination, it will transition to transiting
to the "gather" region, using another muster behavior.

Notes:
============================================

(1) Note that the muster_start behavior has the following configuration:

  capture_flag = AVOID=false
  activeflag = AVOID=true

The capture flat essentially turns off collision avoidance. Once the vehicle has
reached a stable, stationary point, it will not activly collision avoid. The
burden of collision avoidance is on the moving vehicles. If the stationary vehicle
becomes active again during the muster phase, it will resume active collision
avoidance until it captures its set point once again

(2) Known limitation of this mission: When the lead vehicle reaches its destination,
it will activate the "muster_gather" behavior with a different region than the first
muster behavior. Currently the following vehicles will continue to convoy behind
the lead vehcile to the gather region. The GATHER button will send a message to all
following vehicles to stop convoying and also muster at the gather region. Currently
a muster behavior can be configured with only one muster region. The updates feature
can be used to change this dynamically, but the plan is to have the muster behavior
support multiple regions with keys, so only a key name needs to be sent to the
muster behavior rather than a full polygon specification.

(3) The Muster behavior has few improvements pending to help newly entered vehicles
more swiftly make room for later vehicles.
