o Should be robust to losing z vehicle.
o Should be robust to multiple tasks MUSTER_ONE mouse clicks
o left mouse context should station, allstop, return
o rotating poly for vehicle returning? Hex returning, square skeep
  oct, stationkeeping?




Muster behavior
-------------------

o Should be able to ramp up in priority if speed hits zero for some
  period of time. When hightened priority, the muster speed can be
  reduced to creeping rate
o 


ColAvoid behavior(s)
-------------------
Should automatically reduce min_util_cpa, max_util_cpa when
(a) contact is slow/stationary
(b) ownship is already slow/stationary
In such cases, the requested speed should also be low
