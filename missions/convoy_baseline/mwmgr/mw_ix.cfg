Example %MWDataMgr topic inclusion/exclusion configuration file
%The example topics come with an implication that this is for exclusion
%Can be used for both MOOS and ROS topic names. Generally use different conventions so double matchings are not a problem.
%Configuration type for MWDataMgr. Either TOPIC_IX or MOOS_TOPIC_MAPPING
CFGT=TOPIC_IX

%expected configuration is agnostic to MOOS or ROS or how either is used, only matters how it is passed to the program
